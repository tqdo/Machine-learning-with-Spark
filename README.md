# Machine-learning-with-Spark
Predicting whether a client will deposit using Machine Learning with PySpark.

In this notebook, we predict if a customer will enroll for certificate of deposit at a bank. 

The dataset contains bank information on customer demographics, response to marketing events, 
and external environment factors. 

The dataset is balanced and made available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rouseguy/bankbalanced/data
